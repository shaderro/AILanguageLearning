The book that I bought yesterday, which was recommended by my professor, has been extremely helpful in understanding complex grammatical structures.

Although she had studied English for many years, she still found it challenging to master the subjunctive mood, which is often considered one of the most difficult aspects of English grammar.

The students who were selected for the advanced program, having demonstrated exceptional ability in both written and spoken English, will be given the opportunity to study abroad next semester.

It is essential that all participants arrive on time, as the workshop will begin promptly at nine o'clock, and late arrivals will not be permitted to enter once the session has started.

The research conducted by the team of linguists, which spanned over a decade and involved thousands of participants from various linguistic backgrounds, has revealed fascinating insights into how language acquisition occurs in different contexts.

Had I known about the complexity of this grammatical structure earlier, I would have dedicated more time to studying it, but now I must work twice as hard to catch up with my classmates.

The professor explained that the passive voice, which is formed by using a form of the verb "to be" followed by the past participle, is particularly useful when the focus is on the action rather than the person performing it.

What makes this sentence structure particularly interesting is that it allows speakers to emphasize different elements of the sentence depending on their communicative intent, thereby providing greater flexibility in expression.

The committee members, having reviewed all the proposals submitted by the candidates, decided that the project which demonstrated the most innovative approach to language learning would receive the full funding.

Despite the fact that many students struggle with understanding relative clauses, especially those that contain multiple levels of subordination, mastering these structures is crucial for achieving fluency in academic English.

The book that I bought yesterday, which was recommended by my professor, contains numerous examples of complex sentence structures that illustrate how different grammatical elements can be combined to create sophisticated and nuanced expressions.

If the weather had been better, we would have gone to the park, but since it was raining heavily, we decided to stay indoors and practice our grammar exercises instead.
